	// - Inheritance -> When one class inherits non-private methods and variables from another class
	// - Encapsulation -> Restricting direct access to variables within a class
	// - - Access Modifiers: public, private(only seen within the class), protected, default
	// - Abstraction -> hiding implementation (can have abstract and non-abstract methods); Interfaces (only has ABSTRACT METHODS)
	// - Polymorphism -> poly-many, morph-form - many forms; methods that have multiple forms
	// - - method overriding: a sub-class can override a method inherited from the super-class
	// - - method overloading: methods have the same name but with different parameters
	// classes -> create an instance ( creating an object of the class)
